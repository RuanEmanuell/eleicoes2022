## Eleições2022

An app made for checking the results of the Brazilian presidential election in real time using the 
<a href="https://www.tse.jus.br/eleicoes/eleicoes-2022/divulgacao-dos-resultados-das-eleicoes-2022">TSE</a> API.

It's poorly optimized as I only had a few hours to code.

### How to Run

You will need <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install">Flutter</a>, after booting up on your emulator or device and <a href="https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab">starting a new Flutter project</a>, you will transfer the files of this repository folder of your Flutter project. 

### Here are some images of the project running:
